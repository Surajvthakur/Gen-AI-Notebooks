# **AI Workflow Simulation using LangGraph**
## Overview

This project demonstrates an advanced AI workflow simulation using LangGraph, a Python framework for building state-driven workflows.
The AI system executes production tasks, handles anomalies, recharges, processes high-priority orders, and occasionally performs creative synthesis. The simulation models realistic AI decision-making in a step-by-step fashion.

## Key features include:
<UL>
Conditional branching based on AI state.

Looping and anomaly handling.

Energy monitoring and automatic recharge.

Handling and processing of high-priority orders.

Creative synthesis when the AI is curious.

Escalation and reboot for critical failures.

End-of-day standby mode.
</UL>


The simulation runs step-by-step, printing each AI action and updating the AI state accordingly.
